## Reporting a Vulnerability

Since this is a very small project that nobody uses,
it is enough for me to report vulnerabilities via Github issue.
I think vulnerabilities will most likely be related to dependencies.
Of course, there is no bounty for vulnerabilities found in this project, but I will try to fix them.
